            "80C93F45": "What I wouldn’t give to fight again beyond the walls. I would tear out a Vex heart with my teeth, I would sear the Cabal with my burning Light, challenge the Fallen Kells to personal combat and scatter them, I—I’ve been watching too many Crucible matches.",
            "80C93F5E": "Oh my. This is, this is beautiful. You continue to be my greatest success, Guardian. ",
            "80F1E050": "Guardian to the right of you! Guardian to the left of you! Guardian in FRONT of you! VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED!",
            "80F1E19B": "The recruits have no excuses. Look at you! At what one Guardian can do! With nothing but your Ghost, your weapon, and your Light!",
            "80F1E1E2": "The Iron Lords. Six Fronts. The Twilight Gap, where Lord Shaxx earned his name. NONE FELLED MORE GUARDIANS THAN YOU.",
            "80F1E2F9": "FIGHT FOREVER, Guardian!",

            "80F1E68E": "Relax, Guardian. You're scaring them. They'll never want to match with you again.",
            "80F1E690": "I can't believe what I'm seeing!",
            "80F1E692": "With ten Hunters like you, I could make the frontier safe again!",
            "80F1E694": "Your killing intent is unmatched, Hunter!",
            "80F1E696": "With you in the field, no enemy can hide from us, Hunter!",
            "80F1E698": "Some people think I don't like Hunters. I don't. I LOVE THEM.",
            "80F1E69A": "Your strength is an inspiration to us all, Titan!",
            "80F1E751": "With ten Titans like you, I could build all seven columns and shake the pillars to their core!",
            "80F1E7F3": "With you on the field, there isn't a border I could not push, Titan!",
            "80F1E7F5": "Call the Praxic Order! Call the Thanatonauts! The Gensym Scribes! Call EVERYONE—so they can witness you!",
            "80F1E8B3": "Who says Warlocks are better with books than with guns? OK, it was me. But I was lying. Rage is an excellent motivator.",
            "80F1E8B5": "With ten Warlocks like you, I could turn ideas into weapons!",
            "80F1E9F3": "First blood goes to you. They'll seek retribution for this.",
            "80F1E9F6": "Magnificent! Now stay focused.",
            "80F1E9FD": "Oh, the hounds of war are loose!",

            "80F1EAB9": "Now you're fighting with heart, Guardian!",
            "80F1EABB": "This is amazing!",
            "80F1EABD": "Hunters like you blaze a path for the rest of us!",

            "80F1EACD": "Your moments of clarity are weapons, Warlock.",
            "80F1EACF": "THAT shut them down!",
            "80F1EAD1": "You shut the enemy down!",
            "80F1EAD3": "Your enemy can't kill if they're DEAD! Haha!",
            "80F1EC7D": "I'm so proud of you, Guardian, and I want, you to have this.",
            "80F1EE79": "This is—uh, I don't have a medal for this! Hang on!",
            "80F1EE7D": "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT [gasps] I don't have a medal for this! Hang on!",
            "80F1EE89": "[laughs] Oh, no, I don't have a medal for this! Hang on!",
            "80F1F181": "Was that all of them? THAT WAS ALL OF THEM!!",
            "80F1F257": "That was inconceivable!",

            "80F1F25B": "Did you hear that? My soul just shivered.",
            "80F1F4B3": "OH NOOOO! [laughs]",
            "80F5C321": "Strength in numbers, Guardian! Excellent!",
            "80F5CD36": "And that's why we have fireteams!",
            "80F5CD3A": "A fireteam that fights together stays together!",
            "80F5CD42": "What can stop you if you fight together? Nothing!",
            "80F5CF38": "Together as one! I love it!",
            "80C136BE": "Your team should be glad to have you! Good recoveries!",
            "80C136C0": "You never surrender! You're a pillar for your team!",
            "80C136C2": "Good! They can't beat your team if they can't take your crests.",
            "80C136C4": "Good! Your allies know you have their backs!",
            "80C136C6": "I don't think you know how to give up! Good recoveries!",
            "80C136C8": "I love it! You turned the tables on defeat!",
            "80BF5DAF": "Supremacy",
            "80BF5DB0": "Those crests mean glory is yours, Guardian.",
            "80BF5DB1": "The Red Legion couldn't take your glory. And neither can your peers. Excellent.",
            "80BF5DB2": "You've got an armful of crests and all the glory that goes with it.",
            "80BF5DB3": "Warlocks, Hunters, and Titans all have crests. And you take them just the same. Good.",
            "80BF5DB4": "You won today. But respect your opponents. Defeat comes for us all.",
            "80BF5DB5": "I said take the crest--and you took ALL the crests. That's why I like you, Guardian.",
            "80BF5DB6": "My respect for you grows with every crest you claim, Guardian. Well-fought.",
            "80BF5DB7": "Don't let this discourage you. Fight hard, and glory will be yours again.",
            "80BF5DB8": "Everyone loses. Not everyone fights to take their glory back.",
            "80BF5DB9": "There is no true defeat except surrender. Fight again and make glory yours.",
            "80BF5DBA": "You can accept this loss, or you can fight again and reclaim your glory.",
            "80BF5DBB": "Glory comes and goes, Guardian. If you want it, it can be yours again.",
            "80C136D7": "I like your tactics. Glory is yours!",
            "80C136D9": "Crests are glory. Glory is yours!",

            "80C136DF": "This is how you grow stronger.",
            "80C136E1": "You gave your allies the opening--and they found glory!",
            "80C136E3": "Your opponents should tread carefully.",
            "80C136E5": "One to destroy them, the other to claim them! I love it!",
            "80C136E7": "Exquisite! Your allies can't do this alone!",
            "80C136E9": "Your allies FEAST on the glory you've served them!",
            "80BF5DC6": "Defeat your opponent. Then take their crest.",
            "80C136EC": "Careful, Guardian. You must protect your crest.",
            "80C136EE": "Take a Guardian's crest, and glory is yours.",
            "80C136F0": "Slay your opponents. Take their crest.",
            "80C136F2": "The rule is simple. Defeat your enemy. Claim their crest.",
            "80C136F4": "Defeating an opponent drops their crest. That's your cue to take it!",
            "80BF5DCD": "One minute left. The enemy is out of second chances!",
            "80BF5DD0": "Your enemy won the round.",
            "80BF5DD1": "Not this time. You've been defeated.",

            "80BF5DD4": "Not enough. But it's not over.",
            "80BF5DD5": "Thirty seconds. Win or lose, this is the end!",
            "80BF5DD6": "One opponent remains.",

            "80BF5DDE": "Weapons down, and you're alive. That's all I ask.",
            "80BF5DDF": "Your will to live crushed your enemy! Good!",
            "80BF5DE0": "Slay them before they slay you. You make it look so simple.",
            "80BF5DE1": "Out in the field, survival is everything. This match is yours.",
            "80BF5DE2": "I demanded survival. And oh, how you survived. Excellent.",
            "80BF5DE3": "It's Guardians like you who will survive where no one else can. Good.",
            "80BF5DE4": "All opponents defeated!",

            "80BF5DF7": "Death had a hand on your shoulder, so you broke his arm. I love it.",
            "80BF5DF8": "They came close to finishing you. IT COST THEM EVERYTHING.",
            "80BF5DF9": "All enemies down. All lives expended. Total victory.",
            "80BF5DFA": "You're out of lives! Fight on just the same!",
            "80BF5DFB": "Your team's out of lives!",
