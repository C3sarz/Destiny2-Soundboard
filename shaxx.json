            "80BF5D06": "Enemy defused your charge!",
            "80BF5D07": "Not enough. Your charge has been defused!",
            "80BF5D08": "Your charge is defused! A shame.",

            "80BF5D0D": "Excellent! But the charge is ticking! Defuse it!",
            "80BF5D0E": "Well fought. We need Guardians with your passion on the front lines!",
            "80BF5D0F": "And Zavala said Cabal bombs would make poor training tools. *derisive laugh*",
            "80BF5D10": "No advice, Guardian. Do it again!",
            "80BF5D12": "Why can't the rookies be more like you? Just thinking about it infuriates me.",
            "80BF5D13": "You possess extreme patience under duress. You are an inspiration.",
            "80BF5D14": "You held like a fortress! Victory is yours!",

            "80BF5D22": "Enemy sealed your defeat with that detonation.",
            "80BF5D23": "Your opponents know their way around explosives. Again!",

            "80BF5D25": "Pain leads to perfection, Guardian. Embrace it.",
            "80BF5D27": "Countdown tests your patience under fire. You can do this.",
            "80BF5D28": "Whenever you want to try this again, I'll be here. With my bombs.",
            "80BF5D29": "Your charge is set! Let them come.",
            "80BF5D2A": "You've set the charge. Rally your team!",

            "80BF5D32": "*laughs* You don't know when to quit. I love it.",
            "80BF5D33": "YES! You're either very brave or very foolish. I like you, Guardian.",
            "80BF5D35": "Defend those charges, or fight to the bitter end!",
            "80BF5D36": "Defend those charges! The hour is yours!",
            "80BF5D37": "Hold the line! Defend those charges!",

            "80F5C321": "Strength in numbers, Guardian! Excellent!",
            "80F5CD36": "And that's why we have fireteams!",
            "80F5CD3A": "A fireteam that fights together stays together!",
            "80F5CD42": "What can stop you if you fight together? Nothing!",

            "80C136C2": "Good! They can't beat your team if they can't take your crests.",
            "80C136C4": "Good! Your allies know you have their backs!",
            "80C136C6": "I don't think you know how to give up! Good recoveries!",

            "80BF5DB7": "Don't let this discourage you. Fight hard, and glory will be yours again.",
            "80BF5DB8": "Everyone loses. Not everyone fights to take their glory back.",
            "80BF5DB9": "There is no true defeat except surrender. Fight again and make glory yours.",
            "80BF5DBA": "You can accept this loss, or you can fight again and reclaim your glory.",
            "80BF5DBB": "Glory comes and goes, Guardian. If you want it, it can be yours again.",
            "80C136D7": "I like your tactics. Glory is yours!",

            "80C136E7": "Exquisite! Your allies can't do this alone!",
            "80C136E9": "Your allies FEAST on the glory you've served them!",
            "80BF5DC6": "Defeat your opponent. Then take their crest.",
            "80C136EC": "Careful, Guardian. You must protect your crest.",
            "80C136EE": "Take a Guardian's crest, and glory is yours.",
            "80C136F0": "Slay your opponents. Take their crest.",
            "80C136F2": "The rule is simple. Defeat your enemy. Claim their crest.",
